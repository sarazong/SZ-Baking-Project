## Sara Z's Notes/Tips:

Vanilla souffle:

1. To coat the ramekins with butter and sugar, first melt a small amount of butter 
in a microwave or in some hot water. Brush the butter onto the ramekin with upward 
strokes to help the souffle batter rise vertically when bake. Put a table spoon 
of granulated sugar in the ramekin and rotate it until its inside is fully coated 
with sugar. Coating the side of the ramekin with sugar provides surface for the 
souffle batter to rise.
2. When cooking the flour-milk mix in step 5 into paste, make sure to constantly 
stir the mix on low heat to ensure even cooking and prevent burn. Turn off the stove
when the mix has similar consistency as the soft peak meringue. Transfer the 
mix into a bowl to prevent further cooking in the hot pot.


Lemon curd:

1. Zest the lemon(s), but don't cut too deep to avoid the pith, which is the white, 
spongy part of the lemon peel that could taste bitter.
