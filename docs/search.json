    "text": "My name is Sara Zong. “Hou-Sik” is delicious in Cantonese, my mother tongue.\nI love the combination of a coffee/tea and some sweet bake goods, just imagine a cup of pour-over coffee with a freshly out-of-the-oven vanilla souffle 😋.\nBake goods are usually so much better when they just come out of the oven. In addition, I like my treats to be less sugary than what I could buy a lot of the times so that I could better taste the flavor of the ingredients.\nFrom years of working in the laboratory on molecular biology, not only I developed the skills to make precise measurements and follow standard operating procedure easily, but also the habit to understand the purposes of the steps. I enjoy tweaking the process to make it more efficient or to customize the outputs.\nThus, I decided to start my hou-sik baking project. Learning to bake the sweets I love, and to enjoy fresh bake goods with a cup of coffee/tea. Well, I have to admit, there are the influences from The Great British Bake Off and Bake Off: The Professionals. Those bakers in the shows are my inspirations 💡."
