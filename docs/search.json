    "text": "My name is Sara Zong. “Hou-Sik” is delicious in Cantonese, my mother tongue.\nI love the combination of a coffee/tea and some sweet bake goods, just imagine a cup of pour-over coffee with a freshly out-of-the-oven vanilla souffle 😋.\nBake goods are usually so much better when they just come out of the oven. In addition, I like my treats to be less sugary than what I could buy a lot of the times so that I could better taste the flavor of the ingredients.\nFrom years of working in the laboratory on molecular biology, not only I developed the skills to make precise measurements and follow standard operating procedure easily, but also the habit to understand the purposes of the steps. I enjoy tweaking the process to make it more efficient or to customize the outputs.\nThus, I decided to start my hou-sik baking project. Learning to bake the sweets I love, and to enjoy fresh bake goods with a cup of coffee/tea. Well, I have to admit, there are the influences from The Great British Bake Off and Bake Off: The Professionals. Those bakers in the shows are my inspirations 💡."

    "text": "Sara Z’s Notes/Tips:\nVanilla souffle:\n\nTo coat the ramekins with butter and sugar, first melt a small amount of butter in a microwave or in some hot water. Brush the butter onto the ramekin with upward strokes to help the souffle batter rise vertically when bake. Put a table spoon of granulated sugar in the ramekin and rotate it until its inside is fully coated with sugar. Coating the side of the ramekin with sugar provides surface for the souffle batter to rise.\nWhen cooking the flour-milk mix in step 5 into paste, make sure to constantly stir the mix on low heat to ensure even cooking and prevent burn. Turn off the stove when the mix has similar consistency as the soft peak meringue. Transfer the mix into a bowl to prevent further cooking in the hot pot.\n\nLemon curd:\n\nZest the lemon(s), but don’t cut too deep to avoid the pith, which is the white, spongy part of the lemon peel that could taste bitter."

Stop when consistency of the dough is similar to the dough in part 1.\nPut plenty of flour on work bench, knead dough from part 2 lightly and let dough rest for &gt;= 10 minutes.\nRoll dough to the size of the dough in part1, cover dough in part 1 and leave dough in freezer until hard (&gt;= 2 hours!?).\n\n\n\nPart 3: pastry folding\n\nTake the dough out of freezer and leave at room temperature to warm up, ~15 minutes.

Make sure to brush away excessive amount of flour stuck to the dough.\nRepeat 10, 11, and 12 one more time and fold the dough to 1/4 of the rolled out size instead of 1/4 this time.\nFreeze the dough until it’s hard (&gt;= 2 hours!?)\nTake the dough out of the freezer and warm up at room temperature, ~ 15 minutes. Roll the dough out evenly into a 0.3 to 0.4mm sheet, use the fluted cutter to cut out the tart crusts.\nFreeze the crusts till they are hard.\n\n\n\nPart 4: filling\n\nThaw crusts to room temperature, insert one into a mold, gentely press down in the center and turn the mold while continue pressing in spiral motion toward the rim of the mold. Make sure the crust go over the rim of the mold. Put crust back in fridge while preparing for the filling.\nDissolve sugar in hot water and let it cool to room temperature.\nBeat egg, add evaporated milk and sugar water, seive filling to ensure smooth filling after bake."
