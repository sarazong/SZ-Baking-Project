:::{#about-main}
My name is Sara Zong. "Hou-Sik" is delicious in Cantonese, my mother tongue. 

I love the combination of a coffee/tea and some sweet bake goods, just imagine a 
cup of pour-over coffee with a freshly out-of-the-oven vanilla souffle :yum:. 

Bake goods are usually so much better when they just come out of the oven. In addition, 
I like my treats to be less sugary than what I could buy a lot of the times so that 
I could better taste the flavor of the ingredients. 

From years of working in the laboratory on molecular biology, not only I developed 
the skills to make precise measurements and follow standard operating procedure 
easily, but also the habit to understand the purposes of the steps. I enjoy tweaking 
the process to make it more efficient or to customize the outputs. 

Thus, I decided to start my hou-sik baking project. Learning to bake the sweets 
I love, and to enjoy fresh bake goods with a cup of coffee/tea. Well, I have to 
admit, there are the influences from The Great British Bake Off and Bake Off: The 
Professionals. Those bakers in the shows are my inspirations :bulb:.
